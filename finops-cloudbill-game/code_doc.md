## üìù One-Pager: How to Build the **FinOps CloudBill Game** (AWS Edition)

---

### üéØ **Objective**

Create an interactive web-based game where users analyze a mock AWS bill, identify cloud cost ‚Äúleaks,‚Äù and apply FinOps optimization solutions. The experience should be simple, educational, and engaging, simulating real FinOps practices.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend:** HTML & CSS (minimal/no frameworks)
- **Backend:** Python with FastAPI (REST APIs)
- **Containerization:** Docker

### üèóÔ∏è **High-Level Build Steps**

#### 1. **Define Game Flow**
- **Step 1:** Show a simulated AWS bill (with several line items‚ÄîEC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, etc.).
- **Step 2:** Ask players to categorize each line item by cost type (e.g., compute, storage, idle, overprovisioned).
- **Step 3:** Present players with suspicious/wasteful items; let them select the best optimization from multiple choices (e.g., rightsizing, deletion, lifecycle policy).
- **Step 4:** Display the results‚Äîwhat was fixed, total cost savings, leaderboard or score, and a brief quiz.
- **Step 5 (optional):** Give tips, fun facts, or FinOps definitions as positive feedback.

#### 2. **Game Data**
- Prepare a set of mock AWS bills (simple JSON objects listing resources, costs, and brief descriptions).
- Prepare answer keys for the correct categories and best optimizations per line item.

#### 3. **Backend APIs (FastAPI)**
- Endpoint to serve a random mock bill.
- Endpoint to accept user‚Äôs line item categorizations and return validation/feedback.
- Endpoint to accept users‚Äô optimization choices and return ‚Äúbefore/after‚Äù bill with savings.
- Optional: Endpoint for a quiz or to get definitions/tips.

#### 4. **Frontend (HTML/CSS)**
- Page or sections for each game step, switching views as the user progresses.
- Bill displayed in an interactive table.
- Inputs for categorization (dropdowns, drag-and-drop, or simple selects).
- Choice selection forms for optimizations.
- Results summary page.
- Minimal, clear, mobile-friendly design.

#### 5. **Dockerization**
- Package the whole app, including backend and static frontend, using Docker for easy deployment.

### üîë **Key Features & Experience**

- **Fast, simple interactions:** Each round should take only a couple of minutes.
- **Immediate feedback:** Let players know instantly if their choices are correct, and why.
- **Gamified elements:** Scoring, possible badges, and fun language.
- **Learning reinforcement:** Highlight cost-saving best practices, FinOps terminology, and example real-life scenarios.

### üöÄ **How to Proceed with Cursor**

- Use this doc to brief Cursor on requirements, step-by-step flow, and desired learning/gaming experience.
- Specify that backend logic and frontend UI should follow the steps and endpoints outlined above.
- Emphasize user experience: fast, instructive, visually clean, easy to replay with new mock bills.
- Ask for modular, well-documented code, but initial prototype should focus on one complete game loop.

---

**Summary:**  
Build a Dockerized web game using FastAPI (Python) and static HTML/CSS. The game displays an AWS bill, lets users detect/categorize cost issues, suggests fixes, shows the savings, and scores users. All logic is simple, educational, and modular for easy expansion.
